    "agustin": "I had the opportunity to work with Alejandro for a while at TeamKnowlogy, and it was a very positive experience. As a QA Tester, he showed commitment, attention to detail, and excellent communication with the development team. Despite the short time we worked together, his professionalism and positive attitude left a great impression.",
    "lorenzo": "I worked with Ale while he was a QA and I was on the frontend development team. It was truly a pleasure to share a workspace with him. He was always highly committed and willing to help, proactive, and treated everyone with great respect. He was also very open to listening, collaborative, constructive, and always contributed from his role to help us deliver a better product. He brought positive energy even in the most high-pressure moments, and that made a big difference. It would be a privilege to work with him again.",
    "julio": "It is a pleasure to recommend Alejandro as an exceptional professional with whom I‚Äôve had the privilege to work. During our time together, I was able to witness his unwavering dedication, human warmth, and remarkable professionalism. Alejandro stands out for his ability to maintain a high level of commitment and excellence in everything he does. His meticulous approach to tasks and his ability to overcome challenges reflect his strong focus on quality and efficiency. Beyond his technical skills, his empathy and respect for his colleagues are truly admirable. He is always willing to listen and offer support, fostering a collaborative and harmonious work environment. In short, Alejandro is an outstanding person both professionally and personally. His work ethic, empathy, and commitment to excellence are an example to everyone who has the privilege of working alongside him.",
    "ramiro": "Alejandro is one of the best people I‚Äôve had the chance to meet throughout all my years working in software development. He‚Äôs someone who constantly looks for solutions, who will never leave you alone in difficult moments, and whose proactivity at work feels like a natural gift. His ability to learn and adapt to new environments are among the qualities that have impressed me the most over the years working alongside him. There are very few people I would recommend as strongly, and writing these words about Alejandro comes incredibly easily. In short, he‚Äôs the kind of employee every company‚Äîsmall, medium, or large‚Äîwould be lucky to have on their team.",
